# It seems like my app is working with the new back end!
# I got help from the TAs on Sunday (Thank you TAs ily) to get all of my post_controller methods working
# Things seem to work for lab5, though I noticed a few bugs in lab4 and suddenly it seems like my history.push
# isn't working. I'll work on those.

# lab6-annikakouhia

# write up for lab 6
# we put everything together and added in authentication this time.
# I began by putting it into the lab5 backend we had created and making a salt and hash password from the password inputted by the user.
# We also added functionality for signing up and signing in through the backend. Once this was working and we could tag posts based on authors, we moved to the front end to continue the work and mix it into what we had been doing in lab4.
# Together, labs 4 and 5 now add the ability for users to sign up, sign in, and protect their posts by only allowing people to edit and delete posts that are theirs, and only make posts in general if they are logged in.

# I had some trouble with the server and connecting everything, but worked it out with the TAs who save my life weekly. Thank you TAs. You are all wonderful.

# That's about it. I'm drowning a bit in work so no extra credit has been attempted.
